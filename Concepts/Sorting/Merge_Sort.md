# Merge Sort

**As the name suggest we are going to merge to get the sorted array/list/ any linear data structure**

- Questions
- What are we going to merge ?
- what is the motive of this algo like hidden mechanism
- Is this the best we got ?

1. Firstly think of it like a given array is being broken into atomic size at end by breaking into even pieces in each move like below.

2. Then we are going to move them into the merge function where we recursively solve the given atomic value by sorting them and combing them into one.
3. merge function will accept 3 arguments
   1. left sub array
   2. right sub array
   3. orginal array from which these values broken from.

**The Merging happens as below**
