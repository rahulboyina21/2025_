- So when moving from left to right or vice versa try adding the new block while removing the block we are exiting

- What insights could we be getting here
  1. While removing a value and adding a new value we are getting a update value of a subarray of size k which can be maximum or not
  2. if it then we are getting the maximun value of the subarray or not
- All the possible kind of Questions that fall into the sliding window concept are below
  1.Maximum/Minimum Subarray Sum:
  2.Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters:
  3.Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement:
  4.Find All Anagrams in a String:
  5.Smallest Subarray with Sum at Least K:
  6.Maximum Consecutive Ones after Flipping Zeros:
  7.Minimum Window Substring:
  8.Longest Repeating Character Replacement:
  9.Fruit Into Baskets:
  10.Subarrays with Product Less than K:
