GO Lang:

1. Mistake i did 

func main()
{

}

// This has caused the system to throw an error into the terminal reason being the the func and the { opening curly braces should be in the same line weired but it's the rule

// Why is this the case is 

// Every new line is treated like semicolmn in the GoLang so 

main()
{

}

is actually main() ;
{

}
So, the statement is terminated halfway without any syntactical correctness.


2. Importing multiple items at the sametime 

import statment 

everything in the go is made up of the packages but how we are going to get hold of them which are diveresed in the one source is
using the import statement 

import "pkg1" if you have a single package 

but id you have multiple packages then the best optimal way of doing it is 

import 
(
    "pkg1"
    "pkg2"
    "pkg3"
)
incorrect way of doing is 
import ("pkg1" "pkg2") -> can be considered as the concatination operation which will result in a error 

Alternative way

import("pkg1")
import("pkg2")

How to use the imported values in the code

like if i import import("math/rand") Now rand will act as a package where i will use to get the data / info needed to move forward

so fmt.Printf("%d",rand.Intn(10))

// Always export with the capital named variables like pi(invalid) Pi(valid)
But Why 

GO LACKS THE ACCESS Modifiers so 

Private is "Lower Case Varibles" pi

Public is "Upper Case Variables"  Pi

automatically exported and ready to be used when imported i mean if you have the variables in the inital capital letter.
